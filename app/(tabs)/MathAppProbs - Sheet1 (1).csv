12407,"Theresa has 3 rods of equal length, which she can use to form an equilateral triangle with area A. She then cuts one of the rods in half and discards one of the halves.

On the other hand, the area of an isosceles triangle with sides of length 4x, 4x, and 2x can be found by dropping an altitude to the side of length 2x. By the Pythagorean Theorem, the length of this altitude is x√(4^2 − 1^2) = x√15, so the area of this triangle is (2x)(x√15)/2 = √15x^2. Thus, c^2 = (√15/(4√3))^2 = 5/16.",Geometry,Sprint

Otherwise, at least one of the numbers must have two digits. If exactly one of the numbers has two digits, then the only way a and b can be siblings is if the number with two digits is a multiple of 11 and the single-digit number is that number divided by 11. Accounting for order, this yields 2 · 9 = 18 pairs. Finally, if both of the numbers have two digits and are note equal, then a and b must be distinct permutations of each other. Because 0 cannot be a digit in either a or b in this case, there are 9 · 8 = 72 such pairs.

Each of a, b, and c must be between 0 and 9, inclusive, so s must be between 4 and 14, inclusive. In addition, s must be even because a + b + c = 9 + s/2 is an integer.

By inspection, if d = 0, then the tens digit is 0, and if d = 5, then the tens digit is 2. Now, consider the other possible values of d. Notice that these values of d are such that 20ad is equivalent to one of 0, 20a, 40a, 60a, or 80a modulo 100. Because the d^2 term adds a constant to these four values, the tens digit of n^2 will cycle within (0, 2, 4, 6, 8) or (1, 3, 5, 7, 9), in some order, so f(d) = 5 for these values of d, as claimed.",Combination,Sprint

However, if p and q are both positive, we can divide both sides of the equation by p − q to get 3(p^2 + pq + q^2) − 2(p + q) = 1 since p ≠ q. Now let p + q = a and pq = b so that 3(a^2 − b) − 2a = 1. Solving for b yields b = (3a^2−2a−1)/3, which graphs as an upwards-opening parabola. Since p and q are positive, the AM-GM inequality implies that a^2/4 ≥ b.

The desired region is formed by removing △OEF and the segment cut off by CD from the sector with angle ∠EOF. The segment cut off by CD is itself formed by removing △OCD from the sector with angle ∠COD. Observe that ∠COD = 90 and ∠EOF = 120 by special right triangles, so the areas of the respective sectors are 90/360 · 4^2π = 4π and 120/360 · 4^2π = 16/3π. Using base times height, where the chords are considered the bases, △COD has an area of 1/2 · 4 · 4 = 8 and △EOF has area 1/2 · 4√3 · 2 = 4√3. Then the area of the desired region is K = 16/3π − (4π − 8) − 4√3 = 4/3π + 8 − 4√3. Then 4K is approximately 21.04, which rounds down to 21.",Geometry,Sprint
12406,"A train traveling from Waddleton to Lemonstan at a constant speed of 20 miles per hour departs at the same time as a train traveling from Lemonstan to Waddleton at a constant speed of 25 miles per hour. Each train and each station is half a mile long, and there are 99.5 miles of track between the two stations. An ant of negligible size starts at the back of one of the trains and begins walking when the train departs. The ant walks at a constant speed directly towards the front of the train it is on such that it reaches the front of its train no later than the time at which the train reaches its destination. Compute the maximum possible number of hours between the time that the trains depart and the time at which the ant passes the front of the other train.",1000/451,67/30,20/9,1005/451,Other,Hard,1000/451,"Let f(x, y) denote the number of hours it would take given that the train the ant rides on travels x miles per hour and the other train travels y miles per hour. The ant’s beginning and ending points are 99.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 100.5 miles apart. The amount of time it takes to reach the end is equal to the amount of time its train takes to travel 100 miles, which is 100/x hours. The ant’s net speed is then 100.5/(100/x) = 201/200x miles per hour, so the ant and the other train travel towards each other at a combined speed of y + 201/200x miles per hour. However, at the point in time that the ant passes the front of the other train, the combined distance traveled by the ant and the other train is only 100 miles, since the 0.5 miles at the end that the train without the ant started at will not be covered. Thus, the number of hours it will take is f(x, y) = 100/(y+201/200x) = 20000/(200y+201x). To maximize f(x, y), we minimize 200y + 201x = 200(x + y) + x, so we assign x = 20 and y = 25, for which f(20, 25) = 20000/(200·25+201·20) = 1000/(250+201) = 1000/451.",Algebra,Sprint
12406,"Devin develops an infini-sapling, a plant whose roots enter the surface and form a fertile root bulb. Every year, fertile root bulbs can extend the roots deeper, sprouting either zero, one, or two other root bulbs. Most root bulbs sprout 1 new root bulb, but there is a miracle 1/10^9 chance of sprouting two, and an unfortunate 2/10^9 chance of sprouting none. However, regardless of how many more root bulbs it forms, a new fertile root bulb always becomes infertile after a year. Compute the expected number of total root bulbs once all root bulbs have become infertile.",10^9 + 1,10^18 + 1,10^9,10^18,Other,Hard,10^9,"Each root bulb is independent of the others, so we can let r denote the total number of root bulbs that one root bulb may lead to, including itself. Let E(x) denote the expected number of root bulbs for a plant whose starting root bulb extends into x root bulbs. For example, E(0) = 1 since no further root bulbs are formed. In particular, we observe that E(1) = 1 + r and E(2) = 1 + 2r, whatever r may be. Notice that r is the weighted average of the values of E(x), so r = 2/10^9 · E(0) + (1 − 3/10^9) · E(1) + 1/10^9 · E(2) = (2+(10^9−3)(r+1)+(2r+1))/10^9.

Let h(x) = f(x) − g(x). Let M denote the maximum possible achievable value of h(x) over all possible functions h(x) that have a finite global maximum. Compute ⌊M⌋.",51,49,50,52,Other,Hard,49,"Notice that h(x) is the difference between a quadratic polynomial and a linear polynomial, so h(x) is itself a quadratic. Observe that h(x) = a(x−p)(x−q)−b(x−r) = ax^2−(ap+aq+b)x+(apq+br). Since h(x) has a finite global maximum, h(x) must have a negative leading coefficient, so a must be negative. Furthermore, this is a quadratic whose vertex lies on x = −(−ap−aq−b)/2a = 1/2 · (p + q + b/a). Plugging this in yields that the maximum value of h is h(1/2(p + q + b/a)) = a(1/2(b/a + q − p)) * (1/2(b/a + p − q)) − b(1/2(p + q + b/a) − r) = a/4(ba + q − p)(b/a + p − q) − b/2(p + q + b/a − 2r). This simplifies as a/4(b^2/a^2 − (p − q)^2) − b/2(p + q + b/a − 2r) = −b^2/4a − a/4(p − q)^2 − b/2(p + q) + br. We ought to pick an r that is the same sign as b, since we can always do so and that will increase the sum. Recall that a, p, and q are all distinct, and b ≠ r. We proceed to take cases on p + q. If p + q is nonnegative, then b should be negative and equal to −4 because (−4)(−3) > (3)(2) and we want to maximize b^2/(4(−a)) + (−b)/2(p + q). Otherwise, we see that p + q ≥ 2 − 4 = −2 because a is negative, and b^2/(4(−a)) − (p + q) · b/2 + br ≤ 9/(4(−a)) + 3 + 6 when b is positive. By taking b = −3 and r = −4, we can achieve 9/(4(−a)) − (p + q) · b/2 + br ≥ 9/(4(−a)) − 3 + 12 with negative b. We are now trying to maximize −b^2/4a − a/4(p − q)^2 − b/2(p + q) + 12. Without loss of generality, suppose p > q. Then p should be 3 since this only increases the sum. We claim q should be negative: if it is not, then q = 2, so the relevant part of the sum is (−a)/4 · 1 + (−b)/2(5), and we can improve on this by taking q to be the one of −4 and −3 that is not a. Doing this yields (−a)/4 · (3 − q)^2 + (−b)/2(3 + q) = (−a)/4 · 1 + (−b)/2(5) + (−a)/4 · [(3 − q)^2 − 1] + (−b)/2(q − 2), so the desired result holds because (−a)/4 · [(3 − q)^2 − 1] + (−b)/2(q − 2) ≥ 3/4 · [6^2 − 1] + 4/2(−6) = 3/4 · 35 − 12 > 0. Now note that choosing b = −4 is optimal because 16/(4(−a)) + 4/2(p + q) > 9/(4(−a)) + 3/2(p + q), which is true since (p, q) = (3, −3) when a = −4 and (p, q) = (3, −4) when a = −3, with the inequality holding in both cases. Finally, we must choose between (a, p, q, b, r) = (−4, 3, −3, −4, −3) and (a, p, q, b, r) = (−3, 3, −4, −4, −3), which yield maxima of 49 and 583/12 < 49, respectively, so the desired maximum is M = 49.",Algebra,Sprint
